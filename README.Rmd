## Abstract

 The data being analyzed in this exploratory data analysis will come from the Minnesota and Alabama COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) datasets at The COVID Tracking Project. During this exploratory data analysis, I will be comparing the statewide daily positive case increase and population rate of positive cases in the States of Minnesota & Alabama due to their differences in climate hostility throughout the seasons of the year and similar population size. During this analysis, recorded data over the course of a roughly 13-month period from 2/2020 to 3/2021 will be analyzed in respect to the local seasonal climate since data on COVID-19 began getting recorded. How will local climate between states located in a Northern or Southern setting affect COVID-19 data trends? I will be using Rstudio to select and manipulate certain data variables between Minnsota and Alabama, which are respectively located in a Northern and a Southern climate. A possible result that may be concluded from this statistical analysis is that there will be a difference in the percentage of positive case increases during times of the year where the climate in these states is considered hostile.

## Introduction

For the past 12 months COVID-19 has been a prominent scientific topic in both the United States and the world due to its relatively high mortality rate and ability to spread efficiently and unpredictably. The effects of this viral agent have been the cause of many hospitalizations and deaths in a wide range of age groups and heath statuses. 

There has been a large number of studies related to COVID-19 have since been released due to the large effect it has had on the world population's daily lives. With how widespread COVID-19 has become, many location related questions can be asked, such as does the percentage of positive case increases have a correlation with a location's climate and the local population's response to the hostilities associated with that climate during different portions of the year? This data may be used to help predict increases in positive case rates while certain climate changes are approaching within the different states and to allow medical services to be more adequately prepared for a heavier flow of positive COVID-19 cases.

To show how a population's response to local climate hostility may be affecting the COVID-19 positive case increase I will be taking daily data from two populations with different climates over the course of one year.

## Methods
We are displaying our data and our presentation by using R studio and R, the current versions that we are using is R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2020), and for R studio we are using R.Studio 1.4.1103 (RStudio Team 2021)

### Data Acquisition
For this project, all data was analyzed and manipulated using RStudio (RStudio Team 2020). The COVID-19 data acquired between the states of Alabama and Minnesota was gathered from The COVID Tracking Project (The Atlantic Monthly Group, 2021).  On their website, there is data daily data pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic for each state within the United States. To acquire the data, first I opened a new R script in R studio. I used R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team, 2020) and RStudio version 1.3.1093 (RStudio Team 2020).Then I loaded the tidyverse package (Wickham et al. 2019) and the lubridate package (Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham 2011). After doing so I then read in the data for Alabama and Minnesota using the read_csv() function, as shown below (Hadley Wickham and Jim Hester 2020).

### Data Preparation
 After acquiring the data for the two states being analyzed I combined the data for Alabama and Minnesota into one table by using the function bind_rows() (Hadley Wickham et al. 2020). Following this I isolated the target data of total positive cases while adding state population size data (Macrotrends, 2020) by using the tribble function. Then I then bound the Minnesota & Alabama data into another row, followed by using inner_join() to add the population data to the datasets. I then added the COVID-19 positivity rate calculation by using the mutate(Hadley Wickham et al. 2020) command to divide the positive cases by the total population of the respective state. I then divided this by 1000. Finally I selected my target variables to be used for figure building and data analysis.

## Results
The results are based off of daily COVID-19 positive case increase and state population positive COVID-19 case rates between the states of Alabama and Minnesota with respect to seasons(Summer, Winter, ect.) and the climates associated with them.  

There is a steady increase in the number positive case increase recorded during seasons of extreme temperatures in both Minnesota and Alabama. (Figure 1.)

There is a slower rate at which Minnesota COVID-19 cases during extreme heat seasons, Alabama also appears to have a larger amount of individuals with positive confirmed cases during the extreme cold seasons.(Figure 2)

## Discussion

After all results were found, there were some notable trends in the figures presented. The state of Alabama showed a much more evenly distributed curve of positive case increases throughout the year of data collection done, seemingly spiking slightly during the later months of Summer and the early months of Winter. Minnesota showed a lower curve up until the later months of fall, where there then appears to be a significant spike in COVID-19 case increases being recorded. The positivity rates between Minnesota and Alabama shows similar trends to the positive case increase, showing spikes of positivity rates in regards to the statewide population during or near seasons that present local climate hostility. Local responses to seasonal climate, such as being in closed spaces with regulated temperatures, may be the result of spikes in positive COVID-19 case increases and population infection rate. Some other factors that may affect this data potentially include statewide mandates and orders to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, along with local response to COVID-19 and certain times of the year that may lead to an increased exposure for individuals, such as local holidays.

The implications of this study are limited due to the short-term data that was being collected on COVID-19 over the course of the past year. The next steps to this study would be to perform a statistical test on the average rates of COVID-19 infections during the separate months of 2020-2021 while also tracking statewide changes in climate. This would then be used to see if there were any significant differences in the positivity rates during months of climate hostility. I would also expand the number of states being analyzed, using states of similar population sizes and differing climate hostilities
