## Abstract

 The data being analyzed in this experiment will come from the Minnesota and Alabama Covid-19 datasets at The COVID Tracking Project. During this exploratory data analysis, I will be comparing the daily positive case increase in the States of Minnesota & Alabama due to their differences in climate hostility and similar population size. During this analysis, recorded data over the course of a roughly 12-month period from 2/2020 to 3/2021. A possible result that may be concluded from this statistical analysis is that there will be a difference in the percentage of positive case increases during times of the year where the climate in these states is considered hostile.

## Introduction

For the past 12 months Covid-19 has been a prominent scientific topic in both the United States and the world due to its relatively high mortality rate and ability to spread efficiently and unpredictably. The effects of this viral agent have been the cause of many hospitalizations and deaths in a wide range of age groups and heath statuses. 

There has been a large number of studies related to Covid-19 have since been released due to the large effect it has had on the world population's daily lives. With how widespread Covid-19 has become I many location related questions can be asked, such as does the percentage of positive case increases have a correlation with a location's climate and the local population's response to the hostilities associated with that climate?

To show how a population's response to local climate hostility may be affecting the Covid-19 positive case increase I will be taking daily data from two populations with different climates over the course of one year of data.
## Methods

### Data Acquisition
For this project, all the data was analyzed and manipulated using RStudio (RStudio Team 2020). The Covid-19 data acquired between the states of Alabama and Minnesota was gathered from The COVID Tracking Project (The Atlantic Monthly Group, 2021). To acquire this data I first loaded an R script 


### Data Preparation

## Results

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, results = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

```{r}
# loading packages

library(tidyverse)

library(lubridate)


#read in covid data for both Minnesota & Alabama

covidmn <-read_csv("https://covidtracking.com/data/download/minnesota-history.csv")

covidal <-read_csv("https://covidtracking.com/data/download/alabama-history.csv") 

covidmn

covidal

data1 <- bind_rows(
  covidmn,
  covidal
) %>% 
  print()

#printing data
ggplot(data = data1, aes(x = date, y = positiveIncrease)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") + 
  labs(title = "Daily Positive Increase",
       subtitle = " Spring 2020 to Spring 2021",
       x = "Month", y = "Number of positive Covid-19 Cases Recorded") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ state)
```
